### Hi everybody! =D
I'm Gil and I develop free software with a focus on usability.

I am currently working on [Sneezing Goat](https://github.com/gilzoide/bode-espirratorio), a cool game featuring a goat, lots of fun and [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/)!

I'm also a musician and have [some songs recorded](https://soundcloud.com/gilzoide/) ðŸŽµ

Feel free to reach me about anything at all! ^^
