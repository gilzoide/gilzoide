### Hi everybody! =D
I'm Gil and I develop free software with a focus on usability.

I am currently working on [a Lua PluginScript for Godot](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-lua-pluginscript) based on LuaJIT, for using Lua as scripting language in Godot, communicating seamlessly with GDScript / C# / Visual Script.

I'm also a musician and have [some songs recorded](https://soundcloud.com/gilzoide/) ðŸŽµ

Feel free to reach me about anything at all! ^^
