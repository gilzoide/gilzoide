### Hi everybody! =D
I'm Gil and I develop free software with a focus on usability.

I am the author of some Godot plugins:
- [Lua PluginScript](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-lua-pluginscript): a PluginScript for using Lua as a scripting language in Godot based on LuaJIT
- [Dockable Container](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-dockable-container): dockable/tiling UI panels Container addon
- [Dispatch Queue](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-dispatch-queue): threaded and synchronous Dispatch Queues
- [InputKeyEvent Grabber](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-input-key-event-grabber): editor plugin with a button that grabs key events and populates an `InputEventKey` instance, great for creating `ShortCut` resources
- [FixedCellGridContainer](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-fixed-cell-grid-container): simple grid Container with fixed size cells
- [Cubic BÃ©zier Controls](https://github.com/gilzoide/godot-cubic-bezier-controls): bubic BÃ©zier curve Resource and Controls for visualizing and editing them

I also make Unity plugins:
- [Easy Project Settings](https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-easy-project-settings): easily create custom Project Settings by adding `ProjectSettingsAttribute` to your `ScriptableObject` subclass
- [Safe Area Layout](https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-safe-area-layout): uGUI layout group that makes children respect the Safe Area
- [Gradle Wrapper](https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-gradle-wrapper): automatically generate Gradle Wrapper (gradlew) when exporting Android projects
- [Conditional Objects](https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-conditional-objects): scripts for changing object properties or removing objects from Scenes and Prefabs at import time
- [Main Thread Task](https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-main-thread-task): `Task`/`UniTask`-based Main Thread dispatcher classes, no `GameObjects` involved
- [TaskFactoryObject](https://github.com/gilzoide/TaskFactoryObject): `TaskFactory` Unity objects plus a collection of `TaskScheduler`s with optional limited concurrency
- [Serializable Collections](https://github.com/gilzoide/unity-serializable-collections): serializable versions of `Dictionary`, `HashSet` and `KeyValuePair` for Unity 2020.1+
- [Asset List](https://github.com/gilzoide/AssetList): `ScriptableObject` that automatically aggregates assets using `AssetDatabase.FindAssets`

I'm also a musician and have [some songs recorded](https://soundcloud.com/gilzoide/) ðŸŽµ
